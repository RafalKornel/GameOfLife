# Game of life
This project is my attempt on creating celular automata, strictly Conway's Game of life. 
You can read more about this topic on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

You can see working app [here](https://rafalkornel.github.io/GameOfLife/), you can also 
open index.html file after cloning this repository, or host it on live server.

### How to use it
When you enter app, you can either activate cells on grid, by hovering over them and clicking, or select 
one of many presets. After that, just hit switch button on top of right panel.

Have fun!
